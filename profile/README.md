# ORNL PD NSNA

**ORNL PD NSNA** is the GitHub organization for the **Nuclear Structure & Nuclear Astrophysics (NSNA)** research group within the **Physics Division (PD)** at **Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)**.

This org is where our software lives—analysis, DAQ, simulation, utilities, and infrastructure that support nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics research across experiments, facilities, and collaborations.

## What You’ll Find Here

Repositories in this organization may include:

- Data acquisition (DAQ) software and firmware 
- Simulation and modeling tools  
- Experiment-specific utilities and shared libraries  
- Build systems, containers, and environment configs (HPC-friendly)  
- Documentation, examples, and reproducible workflows  

If it runs on a cluster, talks to hardware, or chews through ROOT files, it probably belongs here.

## Scope & Philosophy

- **Experiment-agnostic when possible**  
- **Reproducible over clever**  
- **Readable over “fast but cursed”**  
- Designed to survive long beam campaigns *and* long-term maintenance  

This org is meant to support both current and future experiments.

## Collaboration & Access

- Some repositories may be public; most are restricted to collaborators.  
- Contributions typically follow experiment or project-level policies.  
- If you’re part of an ORNL NSNA effort and need access, reach out to a group maintainer.

## Disclaimer

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, repositories here are **not official ORNL products** and are provided *as-is* for research and collaboration purposes.
